# AlgoVisual
Algorithm visualisation in C++ with SFML

### Side Note
This program is mutli-threaded where one thread is rendering the graphics and the other sorting the random values. Implementing multiple threads was easy to implement, but difficult to work with.

### Installation
This project requires SFML to function. To install SFML:

```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

In order to compile the program, simply run the makefile in the `src` directory by typing `make`. To run the program, type `./algov`.

### Usage
You can randomise the values by pressing `r` and pick between Bubble Sort `b` or Selection Sort `s`.
